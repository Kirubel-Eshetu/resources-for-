# Resources for Learning
A repository where I keep learning resources address. You are invited to check them out to improve your technical skills as a developer.

## From the course "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" taught by Dr. Angela Lu

### For responsiveness using Media Quieries
- Mobile Devices: 319px - 480px
- iPads and Tablets: 482px - 1200px
- Laptops: 1201px - 1600px
- Desktops: 1601px and more.

### For learning Flex-box
- <a href = "https://appbrewery.github.io/flexboxfroggy/" style="text-decoration:none;"> Flex box froggy game </a>

### For learning Grid-box
- <a href = "https://appbrewery.github.io/gridgarden/" style="text-decoration:none;"> Grid Garden Game </a>

### For minifying code
- <a href = "https://www.minifier.org/"> Minify your code </a>
- Minifing means reducing the size of your code through space and comment removal.

### Short Notes
- Higher order functions are functions that can take other functions as inputs.
- Node is not a JavaScript framework, rather Node is a runtime environment. Node allows us to run JS on a computer and not just limited on the computer.


### Fun
- Would like to have fun with the fake hacker typer? then checkout <a href = "https://hackertyper.com/"> hackertyper </a>

### Learn Enough Command Line to be Dangerous
- Visit the <a href = "https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial"> learn enough </a> website

### Common words and Abbrevations

- CDN stands for Content Distribution Network. I have discovered this when learning BootStrap.
- Vanilla language = Pure language without any external libraries and frameworks
  Example: Vanilla CSS = Pure CSS without bootstrap or tailwind css and soon.
- NPM = Node Package Manager
- CJS = Common JavaScript
- ESM = ECMAScript Modules
- EJS = Embedded JavaScript
- JSON = JavaScript Object Notation. This is basically a configuration file.

### HTTP return codes cheat sheet
- GET => Request resource.
- POST => Sending resource.
- PUT => Update by replacing resource.
- PATCH => Update by patching up a resource.
- DELETE => Deleting a resource.
- 1xx => Hold on
- 2xx => Here you go
- 3xx => Go away
- 4xx => You (the user) screwed up 
- 5xx => I (the server) screwed up

### Version control using git and GitHub

Steps to using the command line to commit on a github repository.
  #### Creating Local Repostitory
      1. git init 
      2. git add example1.example1 example2.example2
      3. git commit -m "Your commit message here"

  ### status and rollback
      - git status --> to check the status 
      - git log --> to get information about recent commits made.
      - git diff filename --> check the difference of a file from the original version
      - git checkout filename --> rollback a file to it's last version

  #### Creating Remote Repostirory 
      1. git remote add origin github_repository_url
      2. git branch -M main --> Change the deafult branch to main ( the code is going to be pushed here)
      3. git push -u origin main --> Push the code from local to remote repository
      
  #### Pull requests
  - Pull Requests: Create pull requests to propose changes and request code reviews before merging.

      1. git pull --> pull and merge form remote to local repositories
      2. git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories --> pull form remote repository and merge it by allowing unrelated histories.

 #### git branching
      1. git branch <branch-name> -> to create a new branch.
      2. git checkout <branch-name> -> to switch between branches.
      3. git merge <branch-name> -> to combine changes from one branch into another
      
  #### Git Cloning
      git clone url

  #### Update Git Remote URL
      - git remote -v - Check repository’s remote URL
      - git remote set-url origin https://<your-username>:<your-token>@github.com/repository-url.git - If it’s using HTTPS, update the remote to include your username and PAT.


### APIs
- https://www.bored-api.appbrewery.com/endpoint?query=value&query2=value2. bored-api.appbrewery.com ---> base URL   endpoint ---> endpoint  ?query=value&query2=value2 ---> query

### JSON
- To see a humanoid version of JSON ---> jsonviewer.stack.hu
- A password decoding website ---> base64decode.org
- JSON visualizer --> <a href = "https://jsonviewer.stack.hu/">jsonviewer.stack.hu</a>

### Angular
- Angular supports MVC architecture. MVC architecture allows developers to separate thier code into 3 distinct parts, namely Model, View and Controller.

#### Collaboration addresses
- https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners.git

#### Random Image Resource
- https://picsum.photos/

### React
    1. npx create-react-app your-react-app-name
    2. cd your-react-app-name
    3. npm start
1. Create a new react project.
2. Change the directory into that project folder.
3. Start the server.

#### React's Map, Reduce, Find and FindIndex functions.
- There are three ways to execute these functions.
##### Map Function
const numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30];

1. function square(num) {
  return x * x;
};
- const squareNum = numbers.map(square);
- console.log(squareNum);

2. const squareNum = numbers.map(function (num) {
  return x * x;
});  
- console.log(squareNum);

3. const squareNum = numbers.map((num) => x*x);
- console.log(squareNum);

##### Reduce Function

const numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30];

1. function accNum(accumulator, currentNumber){
      return accumlator + currentNumber;
   };
- const accumulatedNum = numbers.reduce(accNum);
- console.log(accumatedNum);

2. const accumulatedNum = number.reduce(function (accumulator, currentNumber){
      return accumulator + currentNumber;
   });
- console.log(accumulatedNum);

3. const accumulatedNum = number.reduce((accumulator, currentNumber) => accumulator + currentNumber);
- console.log(accumlatedNum); //For checking the output
   
#### Find Function

const numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30];

1. function findNum(num){
    return num < 15;
   }
- const findNumber = numbers.find(findNum);
- console.log(findNumber);  //For checking the output

2. const findNumber = numbers.find(function (num) {
   return num < 15;
   });
- console.log(findNumber);

3. const findNumber = numbers.find((num) => num<15);
- console.log(findNumber);

##### FindIndex Function

- const numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30];

1. function findNum(num){
    return num < 15;
   }
- const findNumber = numbers.findIndex(findNum);
- console.log(findNumber);  //For checking the output

2. const findNumber = numbers.findIndex(function (num) {
   return num < 15;
   });
- console.log(findNumber);

3. const findNumber = numbers.findIndex((num) => num<15);
- console.log(findNumber);

### Starting Servers of different Frameworks

    1. node entryfilename.js / nodemon entryfilename.js (If you have nodemon installed)  => For node, Express
    2. npm start  => For react
    3. ng serve   => For Angular

## MongoDB
- A collection is a group of documents and a database is a group of collections.

## Docker
- You can build an image using the following docker build command via a CLI in your project folder.

      docker build -t welcome-to-docker .

# MongoDB course by Max Schwezner
### Databases, Collections and Documents
- A Database holds multiple Collections where each collection can then hold multiple Documents.
- Databases and Collections are created "lazily" (i.e. when a Document is inserted).
- A Document can't directly be inserted into a Database, you need to use a Collection!
  
### Document Structure
- Each document needs a unique ID ( and gets one by default)
- You may have embedded documents and array fields.
- MongoDB doesn't use JSON but BSON (Binary JSON). We write a JSON file and MongoDB Drivers converts that JSON to BSON.

### Some commands
      use databaseName -> create a new database
      db.dropDatabase() -> Delete a database
      mongoimport filename -d databaseName -c collectionName --jsonArray
      db.createUser({user: "username", pwd: "password', roles: ["readWrite]}) -> Create a user
      db.getUser("username") -> get information about a user

### Concepts
#### What is an ORM (Object-Relational-Mapping)
- An ORM like Prisma is a tool that helps us interact with a relational database using code instead
of writing SQL queries directly. <br />
- Prisma also supports MongoDB, but its feature set is more limited for NoSQL databases. It's still
a great option for basic operations, but Object Document Mappings (ODMs) like Mongoose are more specialized for MongoDB-specific features like embedded documents.

#### Middleware and Routing

- Middlewares are functions that run before the final request handler, modifying the request, response or both. <br />
- Routing defines how requests are handled for specific endpoints and HTTP methods. <br />
- Router-level middleware: Allows for more modular and scalable code organization. <br />
- Error-handling middleware ensures that your app can gracefully respond to issues and provide userful feedback to users. <br />

#### Logging and Monitoring

- Logging and monitoring provide insights into the application's behavior and performance, helping
  track down issues in production. <br />
- Logging: Helps track events and errors that occur while the application is running. <br />
- Monitoring: Helps track the health and performance of your application over time. Example tools: 
  PM2


#### Depolyment and DevOps Basics
##### Environment Configuration

- Environment Conifguration is all about preparing your application to run seamlessly accross different environemnts-development, testing and production. It ensures your app can run in different environments

    - Development Environment: Where you write and test your code locally.
    - Testing Environment: Used for quality assurance and running automated tests.
    - Production Environment: Where your application serves real users.

##### Build and Depolyment Pipelines

- A build and depolyment pipeline automates the process of preparing and pushing your application to production.

- Build: Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript and packages your app for depolyment. <br />
- Test: Runs automated tests to catch bugs before deployment. <br />
- Deploy: Pushes the code to a live environment, making it accessible to users.

##### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment(CI/CD) helps automate the entire development process, from testing to deployment.

###### Continuous Integration (CI)
 - Continuous Integration is a practice where developers frequently push code to a shared repository. <br />
 - Automated tests run on every push to ensure that new changes don't break exisiting code. <br />
 - CI tools: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Travis CI, CircleCI.

##### Continuous Depolyment (CD)
- Continuous Deployment automates the depolyment of code after it passes all the tests in the CI pipeline. <br />
- With CD, once your code passes tests, it automatically gets deployed to production (or desired environment)

## From the course "Tailwind CSS From Scratch - Learn by Building Projects" through O'REILLY by Brad Traversy
### Introduction
#### What is Tailwind CSS
- Tailwind is a CSS framework that uses low-level "utility" classes to create layouts. This is known as a utility-first framework.
- Traditional CSS frameworks like Bootstrap use classes that are directly correlated to components (eg. Alerts, Navbars). Tailwind uses
classes as utilities to put together to build your own custom components.
- Utility classes are simple HTML classes typically scoped to a single and specific CSS property.
